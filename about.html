        <li>Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the richest people in crypto, thanks to his
            FTX exchange and Alameda  Research trading firm, before his empire came
             crashing down in November 2022.</li>
             <li>After users began withdrawing their investments from FTX at a rapid pace, Bankman-Fried
               filed for bankruptcy for FTX FTX's U.S. operations and Alameda Research.</li>
               <li>It's a stunning fall from grace for Bankman-Fried, who had been heralded
                  as a modern J.P. Morgan for swooping in to save troubled crypto firms 
                 before his own firm blew up.</li>
                 <li>The son of two Stanford law professors,he studied physics at MIT and
                     traded ETFs at a quant firm before pivoting to crypto trading in late 2017.
                 </li>
                 <li>Most of his wealth, which peaked at an estimated $26.5 billion, was tied up in
                     ownership of about  half of FTX and a share of its FTT tokens.</li>
